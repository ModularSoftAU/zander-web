# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

zander-web is the web + Discord-bot component of the Zander project: a Fastify web app (dashboard, public site, JSON API) combined with a Discord bot (Sapphire framework) sharing one database layer and one codebase. It talks to game servers via a companion Minecraft plugin ecosystem (e.g. `zander-pgm` for the Mixed module) and to LuckPerms/LiteBans/QuickShop databases that live outside this app's own schema.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev     # nodemon, local development
npm run prod    # production start (app.js directly, larger heap, experimental JSON modules)
npm run build   # npm install + prisma migrate deploy + prisma generate — used by the deploy pipeline
npm test        # vitest run (tests/unit + tests/integration, *.test.mjs / *.test.js)
```

Run a single test file: `npx vitest run tests/unit/mixedAuth.test.mjs`

Database schema changes are Prisma-migration-only (no ORM query usage at runtime for most tables — see below). Add a new folder under `prisma/migrations/NNNN_description/migration.sql` (numeric-prefixed, sequential) and run `npx prisma migrate deploy`. `config.json` and `.env` are gitignored; copy `config.json.example` as a starting point.

## Architecture

### Two runtimes, one process

`app.js` boots a single Fastify app and, in parallel, imports `controllers/discordController.js` which spins up a Sapphire (`discord.js`-based) client. Discord slash commands live in `commands/*.mjs`, event listeners in `listeners/*.js`. Both runtimes share the same DB layer and `controllers/*` modules — a command handler and an HTTP route can call the exact same controller function.

Fastify plugins/routes are registered inside `buildApp()` in `app.js`. Route modules are plain functions taking `(app, config, features, ...)` and calling `app.get/post/patch/delete(...)` — there is no framework-level router file per feature; each domain has its own `routes/*.js` or `routes/dashboard/*.js` file that self-registers.

### Database: dual interface, one physical DB (+ external DBs)

`controllers/databaseController.js` exposes two ways to hit the primary database:
- `prisma` — a wrapped `PrismaClient` (write ops get a 30s hard timeout so a lock never hangs a request indefinitely). Prefer this for new code.
- `db` — a raw `mysql2` pool shim kept for backward compatibility with older callback-style controllers.

Schema changes always go through Prisma migrations (`prisma/migrations/`), but most controllers query with **raw SQL via the mysql2 pool** rather than Prisma Client models — Prisma here is a migration tool, not the primary query layer. Follow whatever pattern the controller you're editing already uses; don't silently convert raw-SQL controllers to Prisma Client calls.

Several *other* databases are connected via raw connection URLs (`LUCKPERMS_URL`, `QUICKSHOP_URL`, `PUNISHMENTS_URL`) for LuckPerms, QuickShop, and LiteBans (punishments) — these are external schemas this app reads/writes into but does not own or migrate.

### Config layering

- `config.json` (gitignored, copy from `config.json.example`) — non-secret operational config, loaded via CommonJS `createRequire` at the top of any file that needs it (`const require = createRequire(import.meta.url); const config = require("../config.json");`), since the project is `"type": "module"` but `config.json` is loaded as CJS.
- `features.json` — boolean feature flags gating entire modules/routes (e.g. `features.mixed`, `features.webstore`). Check this before assuming a module is reachable.
- `.env` — secrets and connection strings, read via `process.env.X` (dotenv loaded once in `app.js`/`api/common.js`). Never put secrets in `config.json`.
- `lang.json` — user-facing string overrides.

### Module pattern (self-contained feature slices)

Larger features (Mixed, Webstore, Events, Forms, Watch/creator content) each follow the same shape: a `controllers/xController.js` (or `api/x/*.js` for multi-file domains) data-access layer, a `routes/xRoutes.js` for public pages, a `routes/dashboard/x.js` + `views/dashboard/x/*.ejs` for the admin UI, and (for API-driven modules) `api/x/admin.js` + `api/x/ingestion.js`/`public.js` for JSON endpoints, each with their own local `guard()`-style auth wrapper. When adding to an existing module, mirror its existing file split rather than inventing a new structure.

The **Mixed** module (public PGM stats portal, `/mixed` + `/dashboard/mixed`, fed by the `zander-pgm` plugin) is the largest and most actively developed slice — see `docs/MIXED.md` for its full data flow, ingestion contract, and the GitHub-repo map-sync subsystem (`services/mixed/`, `lib/mixed/`).

### Auth / permissions

Permissions are dot-notation LuckPerms nodes (e.g. `zander.web.mixed`), checked via `hasPermission(node, req, res, features)` from `api/common.js` for dashboard routes, or module-local `requireXAdmin`/`guard()` wrappers for JSON APIs. Wildcards (`zander.web.*`, `*`) grant broader access — always check for both the specific node and its wildcard ancestors when writing new permission checks (see existing `isAdmin` checks in `routes/mixedRoutes.js` for the pattern). Full permission node reference is in `README.md`.

Plugin-to-server ingestion endpoints (e.g. Mixed's `/api/mixed/*`) use the app-wide `apiKey` Bearer-token scheme, not session auth — see `api/mixed/auth.js`.

### Views

EJS templates under `views/`, rendered via `@fastify/view`. Static assets are served directly from `assets/` at `/`. Admin dashboard pages share chrome via `views/admin/_head.ejs`, `_topbar.ejs`, `_sidebar.ejs`, `_footer.ejs`; public module pages use a per-module `_top.ejs`/`_bottom.ejs` include pair (see `views/modules/mixed/`).

### Cron jobs

`cron/*.js` files are dynamically imported once, unconditionally, near the top of `app.js`. Each file is responsible for its own feature-flag/config gating internally (check `config.mixed?.mapSync?.enabled`-style guards inside the cron file, not in `app.js`) and registers itself with `node-cron` if enabled.
