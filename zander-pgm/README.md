# zander-pgm (ZanderPGM)

A [PGM](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM) companion plugin for the
**Mixed** Minecraft server. ZanderPGM turns PGM match/objective/stat events into
internal DTOs and streams them to **zander-web** over REST (and optionally
WebSocket), and adds Map Tokens, Map Voting and post-match Map Ratings.

```
PGM events -> zander-pgm trackers -> internal DTOs -> zander-web API/WebSocket
```

> This repository contains the **Minecraft plugin only**. The web side is the
> separate **zander-web Mixed module** (public section `/mixed`).

## What "Mixed" is

Mixed is a PGM game mode / server run under the zander stack. ZanderPGM is the
in-game bridge that records what happens on Mixed and reports it to zander-web
for stats, profiles, leaderboards, maps, voting, ratings and store integration.

## What zander-pgm does

- Tracks the PGM **match lifecycle** (loaded / started / ended).
- Tracks **player stats** (kills, deaths, assists, first bloods, killstreaks).
- Tracks **big stats** where practical (damage, bow accuracy, blocks).
- Tracks **objective events** (wool, flag, core, destroyable, control point).
- Tracks **map stats** (times played, average duration, win rates).
- Awards **XP / levels** and unlocks **achievements**.
- Supports **Map Tokens**, **Map Voting** and **post-match Map Ratings + feedback**.
- Emits **Discord hook** events to zander-web (zander-web decides what to post).

## Integration with PGM

PGM is a **required** dependency (`depend: [PGM]`). ZanderPGM integrates with PGM
**reflectively** — PGM event classes are resolved by name and registered through
a Bukkit `EventExecutor`, and match/map details are read via reflection. This
keeps the module compiling without the PGM artifact on the build classpath and
degrades gracefully across PGM versions: unknown events are simply skipped. Death
tracking additionally uses Bukkit's `PlayerDeathEvent` so it works regardless of
PGM's internal event names.

## Sending data to zander-web

All outbound calls run **off the main thread** (JDK `HttpClient`), use
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and include the server id, plugin version and a
timestamp. If zander-web is offline the plugin keeps running; failed events are
queued (bounded; oldest dropped when full) and retried, optionally in batches.

### Required dependencies

- **Paper** 1.21+ (`paper-api`)
- **PGM** (runtime, required)
- Gson (shaded), JDK 17 `HttpClient`/`WebSocket`

## Config setup

Edit `config.yml` after first run. At minimum set:

```yaml
server:
  id: "mixed-1"
api:
  baseUrl: "https://craftingforchrist.net/api"
  token: "<value of the zander-web API token>"
```

Feature flags under `features:` toggle every subsystem; token/vote/rating
behaviour is tuned under `mapTokens:`, `mapVoting:` and `mapRatings:`. Mixed
REST/WebSocket auth is always sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The
plugin accepts `api.baseUrl` as either `https://host` or `https://host/api`.

## Permissions

`zanderpgm.admin` (op), `zanderpgm.vote`, `zanderpgm.rate`, `zanderpgm.stats`,
`zanderpgm.profile`.

## How Map Tokens work

Players buy/earn tokens on zander-web and spend them to influence map selection:
nominate a map into the next vote (1), set the next match (3), or sponsor a
featured vote option (5). zander-pgm polls zander-web for pending requests,
validates them (map exists, enabled, not blacklisted, cooldowns, minimum
players), and applies valid ones to the **next** match/vote — never interrupting
a running match. Failures are reported back so zander-web can refund tokens when
`refundIfFailed` is set. Lifecycle events: `MAP_REQUEST_RECEIVED / ACCEPTED /
APPLIED / REJECTED / FAILED / REFUNDED`.

## Map Tokens Commands

Admin and console commands:

- `/zpgm maptokens grant <player> <amount> [reason]`
- `/zpgm maptokens remove <player> <amount> [reason]`
- `/zpgm maptokens set <player> <amount> [reason]`
- `/zpgm maptokens balance <player>`
- `/zpgm maptokens history <player> [page]`
- `/zpgm maptokens status`
- `/zpgm maptokens clear`
- `/zpgm tokens ...` works as an alias for the same subcommands

Permissions:

- `zanderpgm.maptokens.admin`
- `zanderpgm.maptokens.grant`
- `zanderpgm.maptokens.remove`
- `zanderpgm.maptokens.set`
- `zanderpgm.maptokens.balance.others`
- `zanderpgm.maptokens.history`
- `zanderpgm.maptokens.status`
- `zanderpgm.maptokens.clear`

Webstore package command examples:

- `zpgm maptokens grant {name} 1 "Store: 1 Map Token"`
- `zpgm maptokens grant {name} 3 "Store: 3 Map Tokens"`
- `zpgm maptokens grant {name} 7 "Store: 7 Map Tokens"`
- `zpgm maptokens grant {name} 20 "Store: 20 Map Tokens"`
- `zpgm maptokens grant {name} 45 "Store: 45 Map Tokens"`

Recommended store packages:

- `1 Map Token - A$2`
- `3 Map Tokens - A$5`
- `7 Map Tokens - A$10`
- `20 Map Tokens - A$25`
- `45 Map Tokens - A$50`

Rank bonus command examples:

- `zpgm maptokens grant {name} 1 "Iron monthly Map Token bonus"`
- `zpgm maptokens grant {name} 3 "Gold monthly Map Token bonus"`
- `zpgm maptokens grant {name} 15 "Gold permanent Map Token bonus"`
- `zpgm maptokens grant {name} 7 "Diamond monthly Map Token bonus"`
- `zpgm maptokens grant {name} 35 "Diamond permanent Map Token bonus"`

Rank token bonuses:

- `Iron monthly: 1 token/month`
- `Gold monthly: 3 tokens/month`
- `Gold permanent: 15 tokens once`
- `Diamond monthly: 7 tokens/month`
- `Diamond permanent: 35 tokens once`

Storage location:

- `plugins/ZanderPGM/map-tokens/map-tokens.json`

Troubleshooting:

- If console grants fail for offline players, confirm the player has joined before so Bukkit has cached profile data.
- If zander-web is offline, balances and history still persist locally and outbound Mixed events queue through the existing event transport.
- `clear` only clears the pending next-map override; it does not change balances or delete history.

## How Map Voting works

Before the next match a vote is created (default 4 options, 45s window, one vote
per player, changeable while active). Options come from rotation/random/featured
maps plus token nominations/sponsorships (sponsored maps get a boost weight).
The winner becomes the next map. Web voting is handled by zander-web (login +
linked Minecraft account). Admins can start/end/cancel votes. Votes apply to the
next match only.

## How Map Ratings and feedback work

When a match ends, participants are prompted to rate the map 1–5 (configurable
window, default 180s). One rating per player per match, updatable during the
window. Optional feedback (max 300 chars) is stored in zander-web for
admin review and optional public display. Only players who played the match may
rate it.

## Building

This module is part of the `zander` Maven reactor and builds with Java 17.
`paper-api` is resolved from `https://repo.papermc.io`; the build needs network
access to that repository. From the repo root:

```
mvn -pl zander-pgm -am package
```

The shaded jar lands in `zander-pgm/target/` (and the aggregated
`target/plugins/` directory).

## Manual test checklist

1. Start server with PGM and zander-pgm.
2. Confirm startup detects PGM.
3. Confirm heartbeat reaches zander-web.
4. Load a PGM map — confirm `MATCH_LOADED` is sent.
5. Start match — confirm `MATCH_STARTED`.
6. Kill a player — confirm `PLAYER_DEATH`.
7. Complete an objective — confirm `OBJECTIVE_EVENT`.
8. Finish match — confirm `MATCH_ENDED` + stats snapshots.
9. Confirm players receive the `/maprate` prompt; submit `/maprate 5` and
   `/maprate 4 optional feedback`; confirm the rating event is sent.
10. Start a vote, `/vote <number>`, confirm the vote event and that the winner
    becomes the next map.
11. Receive a Map Token request from zander-web; confirm validation, apply/reject
    and result reporting.
12. Stop zander-web — confirm events queue instead of crashing. Restart it —
    confirm the queue flushes.
